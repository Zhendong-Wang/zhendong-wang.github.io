I am a second year PhD student in the department of Statistics & Data Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I am supervised by professor [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). Before coming to UT, I completed my Master degree at Columbia University in Data Science major. I received my Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering from Tongji University in China, during which I went to the University of California, Berkeley for one year exchange study.

My research interests lie in developing deep generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, reinforment learning algorithms with the help of statistical tools and better uncertainty quantification methods for implicit-density models.
