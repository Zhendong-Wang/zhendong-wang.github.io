I am a **Senior Researcher** at the Microsoft GenAI Team. I completed my **PhD in Statistics and Data Science** at the **University of Texas at Austin**, where I was supervised by [Prof. Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). Prior to UT Austin, I earned a **Master’s degree in Data Science** from **Columbia University** and a **Bachelor’s degree** from **Tongji University** in China. During my undergraduate studies, I spent a year as an exchange student at the **University of California, Berkeley**.

### Research Interests
My research interests span **deep generative models**, **reinforcement learning**, and their applications. Specifically, I am interested in:  
- **Deep Generative Models**: diffusion models, GANs, and related methods.  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: online/offline RL, imitation learning, and policy optimization.  
- **Multimodal Large Language Models**: interleaved text-image generation, preference optimization algorithms, and related advancements.  
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: conformal predictions and robust modeling techniques.  

I am always open to collaborations, discussions, and exploring new opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in my research or would like to discuss potential projects. If you’re seeking intern opportunities, I’d be happy to connect!
