We share a series of diffusion distillation works:
 - **Score identity distillation: Exponentially fast distillation of pretrained diffusion models for one-step generation [ICML 2024]** A fundamental distillation technique SiD through Fisher Divergence. 
 - **One-Step Diffusion Policy: Fast Visuomotor Policies via Diffusion Distillation** Coupling with CFG, SiD works well in text-to-image one-step generation. 
 - **Adversarial Score identity Distillation: Rapidly Surpassing the Teacher in One Step** Introduce the data dependency to eliminate pretraining bias and further boost the performance of SiD.
